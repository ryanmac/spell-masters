## Why Spell Masters?

As a parent of homeschooled children, I created Spell Masters not only to address a gap I saw in existing spelling apps but also as a fun and meaningful project to build alongside my kids. We wanted a tool that was effective, engaging, and respected our family's privacy. This collaborative effort allowed us to spend quality time together while developing a comprehensive spelling platform that grew beyond our initial vision. Now, I’m excited to share this tool with other families and educators who seek a fun, privacy-conscious, and effective way to enhance spelling skills. 

By building Spell Masters, we’ve combined learning and play, turning spelling practice into an exciting adventure for our whole family, and we hope it can do the same for yours.
